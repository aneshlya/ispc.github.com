<h1>ispc 1.13.0 is Released</h1>
<p>An ISPC update, which graduates cross-compilation support to production and
has multiple code generation improvements and bug fixes. AVX512 targets may
get the biggest performance boost due to changed internal representation of
masks (we observed up to 5% speedups), and new switch '--opt=diable-zmm',
which disables using zmm registers in favour of ymm for avx512skx-i32x16 target.
All targets will definitely benefit from LLVM 10.0 backend used in this release.</p>
